Solutions to LeetCode problems in Python3

## Results
### Problem 1
- **Name**: Two Sum
- **Runtime**: 84 ms
- **Memory**: 16 MB
- **Solution**: Pop from the string front, add unless the next numeral is higher, in which case subtract.

### Problem 2
- **Name**: Add Two Numbers
- **Runtime**: 116 ms
- **Memory**: 14 MB
- **Solution**: Long addition using a carry, and using the original linked-lists as output in-place.

### Problem 3
- **Name**: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- **Runtime**: 67 ms
- **Memory**: 14.1 MB
- **Solution**: Keep track of previous positions in a dict, keep track of the start of current duplicate-free string candidate.

### Problem 5
- **Name**: Longest Palindromic Substring
- **Runtime**: 4052 ms
- **Memory**: 13.9 MB
- **Solution**: Because input size is small, just brute-forced checked for palindromes around each character.

### Problem 6
- **Name**: Zigzag Conversion
- **Runtime**: 70 ms
- **Memory**: 14.2 MB
- **Solution**: A closed form formula for the position of a character in the zig-zag grid can be made with modular arithmetic, after that it's a matter of sorting.

### Problem 7
- **Name**: Reverse Integer
- **Runtime**: 39 ms
- **Memory**: 14 MB
- **Solution**: Use modular arithmetic to chop down the number, checking for overflows by moving subtractions and dividions across the inequality.

### Problem 13
- **Name**: Roman to Integer
- **Runtime**: 66 ms
- **Memory**: 14 MB
- **Solution**: Pop from the string front, add unless the next numeral is higher, in which case subtract.

### Problem 234
- **Name**: Palindrome Linked List
- **Runtime**: 932 ms
- **Memory**: 46.5 MB
- **Solution**: I just converted to list and compared reverse. O(1) space is possible by first counting the middle position, then reversing the second half, and walking through both comparing.
